# AWS Resume Challenge with Terraform

This project is part of the AWS Resume Challenge, where I showcase my skills in cloud computing and infrastructure management using Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Terraform.

## Overview

The AWS Resume Challenge is an initiative aimed at creating a resume website hosted on AWS to demonstrate proficiency in cloud computing technologies. In this project, I have used Terraform to provision and manage the infrastructure required to deploy my resume website on AWS.

## Features

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform: All AWS resources are defined and managed using Terraform, enabling version-controlled infrastructure changes and easy replication.
- AWS Services Integration: Leveraging various AWS services such as EC2, S3, Route 53, and ACM to deploy a scalable and reliable resume website.
- Continuous Deployment: Implementing continuous deployment pipelines to automate the deployment process and ensure efficient updates to the resume website.
